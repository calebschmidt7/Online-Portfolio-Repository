      <p>I've always been creative, but just lacked the way to express it.  As much as I wish otherwise, drawing and painting was never my forte and photographs are better taken by other people. But when I discovered I could tell the computer to "draw" for me, I was hooked.<br> Programming has become my passion, specifically Web Design. I am now an aspiring web designer who is a life-long learner and always interested in expanding my skills.
